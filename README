read/validate and diff .icf files

=== synopsis ===
$ icfdiff f1.icf           # validate
$ icfdiff f1.icf f2.icf    # diff

=== configuration parameters ===
CFGPATH
  default paths are to find include files not in cwd
  if the original file has postfix like .gz, included ones are to find .gz
    postfixed files in .gz paths before default; same goes for .new, .bz2, etc
  /default/path1;.new:/new/path1:/new/path2;.gz:/gz/path1:/gz/path2;/default/path2
EXCLUDE
  some included .icfs aren't essential for validate/diff and if excluded speeds up
DEFAULT
  naturally DEFAULT group includes everything, but we can override it to contain,
  say, "Pirarras,Munduruku,Parintintin"
DISPLAY_PREFIX
  simply prefix all output lines with a custom header

=== .icf file ===
a flexible multi-dimentional configuration file scheme, based on the concept
of "groups" and "kv pair".

for example
# group definitions
  @AFRICA  lion hyena proteles painter catamount
  @AMERICA cougar puma panther mountain_lion
  @ASIA    tiger panda wolf
# icf configuration
  animal:genus=cat,specy=tiger  AFRICA   nail=sharp color=yellow
  animal:genus=cat,specy=tiger  AMERICA  nail=sharp color=yellow

=== icfdiff ===
works by first expanding all config lines to the atom/symbol/item level,
then diff on every key, treat the diff result as a new .icf file,
and then group the same diffs (i.e. kv pairs) back to known groups

=== todo ===
* work on groups directly rather than expanding them
  by defining them with set relationships: A < B, A+B=C, a << A, a+b+c+d=A, etc
  eg. ALL_EQUITY = OTC+LISTED+PINK+BB
      FINANCIAL_INSTRUMENTS > ALL_EQUITY
* semantics plugin
